# C_PROJECT_BOUNCE_BALL
This is simple game built during my project submission for c programming language using graphics.Initially ,it allows the user to enter any key to start the game. Then ,the ball appears randomly on the different position within the boundary between the bar moved and the windows. Users can move the bar using the arrows key to hit the ball .when the ball hits the bar, itâ€™s speed increases successively on each rebounce, the each corresponding hits denotes the score of 10,which gets continuously increases until the users miss to hit the ball .If the ball goes below the bar when the users misses to hit it, it automatically restarts  the game and after attempting five try,the game is over and the total score is displayed on the screen .After game over, it again allows the users to restart the game.
